I am very traumatized by lightning because I have seen lightning very closely from the age of toddler to old age. What was unforgettable when I went to college and took care of my thesis there was a thunderbolt in the food stall when I sent an SMS in the rain. I was also traumatized by lightning when I was a toddler I took a shower in a bathroom without a roof but the lightning was so big it sounded blaring above me. I have also felt the presence of lightning which is very close during prayer where the conditions are at night and it is shocking because suddenly the sound is big and everything looks bright limited in just one second.
